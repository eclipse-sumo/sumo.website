Q: What is the difference between SUMO and MATSim. In mathematical models used? 
A: Sumo uses car-following and lane-changing models whereas MATSim uses a coarser and faster queuing model (very similar to SUMO-meso). MATSim also includes models for building a virtual population and their plans (whereas SUMO requires those plans as input)

Q: Is it possible to draw the TAZ in different shapes (say I want to draw a TAZs based on neighborhoods) using the tool shown in the tutorial?
A: Arbitrary polygonal shapes can be drawn. TAZ can also be built based on shapes from OSM: https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Tools/District.html#edgesindistrictspy

Q: Do you plan to improve or update Traci? Currently, I am trying to integrate Sumo to Unity, and road construction was a bit hard. The shape list of a lane only gives information about the center line, but  I needed end points of a lane in Unity.
A: TraCI is mainly for dynamic features. Lane geometry is static and tools/sumolib is the recommended library to retrieve this data. sumolib.geomhelper.move2side can be used to compute the outer boundary for a given lane center line.

Q: Is it possible to automatically optimize traffic light signal plans. By changing green times and/or cycle times. By running multiple simulations and resulting into an optimum. Which is minimal traffic delay.
A: Sumo does not include tools for iterative optimization. Timing and offsets can be optimized for given traffic demand: https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Simulation/Traffic_Lights.html#improving_generated_programs_with_knowledge_about_traffic_demand

Q: I see you plan to couple SUMO with some pedestrian models. Which pedestrian models do you think are good candidates for this?
A: We plan to couple SUMO with JuPedSim which contains multiple models. Social Distance and Cellular automaton models could all be useful. Any kind of model as long as it's fast enough.

Q: What is the most efficient way to estimate travel times for paths from SUMO simulation output?
A: edgeData-output with duarouter or tripinfo-output with vehicles that drove the desired paths

Q: How can one associate trips generated from od2trips with passenger cars exhibiting varying behavior (e.g. in terms of car-following or lane changing)?
A: od2trips option --vtype TYPEID and then in sumo load an additional file that defines vTypeDistribution TYPEID (https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Definition_of_Vehicles%2C_Vehicle_Types%2C_and_Routes.html#vehicle_type_distributions)

Q: Is there any weather information in sumo?
A: There is no direct support for weather but sumo can associate arbitrary date with network edges using generic parameters (https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Simulation/GenericParameters.html) and custom models can access these parameters.

Q: Does SUMO support multi-cores cpu? how to set SUMO simulation setting in order to fully utilize the computer resources such as multi-core cpu or GPU?
A: Routing can be parallelized over multiple cpu cores with sumo option --device.rerouting.thread and duarouter option --routing-threads. SUMO also supports option --threads for multi-core simulation but the realized speed-up is currently low. GPUs are not supported.

Q: About TAZ: Is it possible to only allow specific edges to be a origin/destination edge in a TAZ?
A: Yes. gridDistrict.y and edgesInDistrict.py support option --vclass. filterDistrict.py also filters and existing TAZ with option --vclass

Q: By any chance, are you aware any study using SUMO for simulating logistics process, e.g., in container terminals (or production systems in factory)? Thank you.
A: https://elib.dlr.de/97714/1/SUMO2015_Proceeding.pdf

Q: Can I change lane change parameters such as lcPushy, lcAssertive during the simulation via Traci ?
A: Yes. traci.vehicle.setParameter(vehID, "laneChangeModel.lcPushy", str(value))

Q: Is it possible to control a pedestrian like I can control an ego car using an XBOX (or similar) controller?
A: Yes. traci.person.moveToXY

Q: How the TAZ is created, and who create it?
A: Candidate tools: netedit, polyconvert+edgesInDistrict.py, gridDistricts,py

Q: Is it possible to change the net connections in real time using an existing TraCI module?
A: Yes. traci.edge.setAllow(internalEdgeID, "authority") -> normal cars cannot use this connection anymore. See https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/sumo-gui.html#investigating_internal_edges_and_lanes

Q: What are the main uses of SUMO for V2X?
A: mobility model for communication simulation, cooperative behavior (i.e. platooning, smart traffic lights)

Q: Can you briefly describe how the Python packages work? Is it the recommended way to start and run simulations from Python?
A: Many python tools are stand-alone. tools/sumolib is for writing own tools (i.e. analyze networks), tools/traci is for coupling own code to a simulation (which can be started with traci.start).  Normally sumo is started from the command line, batch files etc.

Q: There are several car-following-models, do you know if they give results comparable to the one used by SUMO?
A: All model behave differently. The same model implemented in different simulations should mostly work the same but there are difference in situations that are not fully described by the model (i.e.
how to stop at intersections).

Q: Is there a workaround to show WMS layers as background map in SUMO-GUI? or such feature needs to be carefully developed (hopefully for future releases)?
A: SUMO only supports backgrounds via raster images. Those can be imported from WMS via tileGet.py: https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Tools/Misc.html#tilegetpy

Q: Is it planned to implement another lane change model, for example MOBIL?
A: Not directly but the API is module and pull-request are very welcome. The SUMO-team may be able to give support to anyone willing to do so.

Q: Topic train/bus tls request: Is it possible to create a traffic light program with a (preferred) bus/train request without TraCI?
A: Actuated traffic lights support custom detectors and those can filter by vType. Together with a branching program this could make the traffic light adapt to public transport:
https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Simulation/Traffic_Lights.html#dynamic_phase_selection_phase_skipping

Q: Is it possible to define a minGap when a car passenger follows a heavy truck and a minGap when following an ordinary vehicle? 
A: No by default but it's possible via TraCI or custom carFollowingModels

Q: Is there a way to have a command-line SUMO as a "server" and connect something like SUMO-GUI to it? E.g. running a SUMO in docker and check how the simulation runs?
A: Yes. See https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Tools/Misc.html#statereplaypy. Additional features are planned.

Q: Is it possible to embed rerouters to divert pedestrian traffic temporarily?
A: No. Rerouting pedestrians only works via TraCI at the moment.

Q: I find sometimes emergency vehicle (has been equipped with bluelight device and permitted to violate red light through setting jmDriveAfterRedTime) does not change lane to pass intersection during red light, is there any possible reason for it and how to solve it?
A: Possible bug, please send in minimum example scenario.

Q: The number of teleports increased considerably when we use calibration ? Do you have any idea about that?
A: If calibration increases traffic, any problems with the network/infrastructure model likely show up as jamming/teleports.

Q: When SUMO automatically generates traffic light sequences, does it estimate flow rates?
A: No. Flow can be incorporated into signal plans via extra tools: https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Simulation/Traffic_Lights.html#improving_generated_programs_with_knowledge_about_traffic_demand

Q: Is this session of the tutorial being recorded?
A: Q&A is not recorded

Q: Have you mapped the historical data based on GTFS-R data?
A: No. Import into static scenarios should work. 

Q: I have a very little experience about this, but, are there many implementations of SUMO connected with real-time data from Waze and tomtom (car flow applications)? I would appreciate if you have any links to share as well. Thank you.
A: We are not aware of this kind of coupling. 

Q: Is there any efficient way to insert a new phase during a cycle? Now I implement it by switching to a new program and switch back to the original
A: For various options see https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Simulation/Traffic_Lights.html#controlling_traffic_lights_via_traci

Q: I have noticed that when the vehicles change lanes, they change at 90 degrees in the adjacent lane. Is it possible that they line up over a greater distance like in real life? 
A. See https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Simulation/SublaneModel.html

Q: Does SUMO used for only virtual scenarios which are similar to reality or do we have implementation in the real world?
A: All scenarios are virtual in a sense but some there are some projects with tight coupling to real-time data. (https://elib.dlr.de/105545/1/HEUREKA%2717_VITAL_online.pdf)

Q: Can SUMO simulate electric vehicles, and charging infrastructure? Can sumo-gui show the charging state?
A: Yes: https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Models/Electric.html To see the charging state, Set vehicle coloring to "by param (numerical)" and use parameter "device.battery.actualBatteryCapacity". Optionally activate checkbox "show vehicle color value". (https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/sumo-gui.html#vehicle_visualisation_settings)

Q: Can Sumo restrict the set of persons that may enter a vehicle at a stop?
A: Yes. using stop-attribute 'permitted' (https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Definition_of_Vehicles%2C_Vehicle_Types%2C_and_Routes.html#stops)
