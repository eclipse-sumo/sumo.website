The SUMO User Conference, held every year in Berlin since 2013, is a must-attend event for anyone involved with SUMO. It gathers international participants from the industry, research and public institutions - to present (among others) projects, studies and advancements all around traffic, simulation and SUMO.

The conference is a great place to learn about new features, network with fellow enthusiasts, ask the developers, have fruitful discussions, exchange ideas and even start collaborations!
