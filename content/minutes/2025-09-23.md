## Attendees

- Jakob Erdmann (DLR)
- Ronald Nippold (DLR)
- Peter Wagner (DLR)

## Topics

- Release 1.25 moved to 27th of October (holidays)
- we have 102 different labels which might not all be useful
  - we review them on demand
- max-num-vehicles / max-num-persons
  - SUMO user wanted to use this type specific, we do not see the need

## Issues

- SUMO has now routing types to define vehicle type / class specific preferences for certain edges
  - https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Simulation/Routing.html#routing_by_travel_time_and_routingtype
  - netedit support is open
- automated routing can now be avoided if the improvement is below a threshold
  - routing performnace might also benefit -> Micha opens an issue
- we have now parsable metadata
