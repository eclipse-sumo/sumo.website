The SUMO User Conference, held every year in Berlin since 2013, is a must-attend event for anyone involved with SUMO. It gathers international participants from the industry, research and public institutions - to present (among others) projects, studies and advancements all around traffic, simulation and SUMO.

The conference is a great place to learn about new features, network with fellow enthusiasts, ask the developers, have fruitful discussions, exchange ideas and even start collaborations!

# Paper Submission

There are two submission types:

---

1. Scientific Papers:
   - All accepted scientific papers must be presented at the conference.
   - Scientific papers will be reviewed by at least 2 reviewers.
   - All accepted scientific papers will be published in the [SUMO proceedings](https://www.tib-op.org/ojs/index.php/scp/index).
   - Scientific papers should be between 5 and 20 pages long.
   - **The Paper must be submitted in LaTeX or Word format before Sunday,** ~~February 16, 2025~~ <span class="badge badge-warning">New</span> **February 23, 2025 at 11:59 PM (Berlin time)**.

2. Posters:
    - The SUMO conference gives the opportunity to present your topic during the poster session.
    - There is no need to write a scientific paper.
    - Possible contents can be:
        - Results of Bachelor or Master theses
        - Live Demos
        - SUMO Use Cases
        - Project Presentations
        - Work in Progress which would benefit from the feedback of other SUMO users
    - The Posters do not require following a specific template, but should be formatted in the A0 size (841 x 1189 mm / 33.1 x 46.8 in).
    - We will print the poster for you, provide the display panel, a chair and a table.
    - While changes to the poster are still possible after the submission deadline, we unfortunately will not be able to reprint it. If you do need to make changes, you would need to bring a printout of the updated version with you.
    - You are welcome to bring a laptop or other device to show a demo, slides, videos or any material that you deem appropriate to complement the presentation. In this case you will need to provide your own equipment.
    - **Title and a short abstract (up to 300 words) must be submitted until Sunday, February 23, 2025, at 11:59 PM (Berlin time)**.

# Keynote

<h3><i>Movement and waiting of crowds – state of the art models and data</i></h3>

The contribution starts with a historical review of the connection 
between modelling and technical possibilities of data collection. This 
is followed by an overview of current approaches to modelling the 
movement of individual pedestrians in crowds. These include cellular 
automata, force as well as speed models, and trajectory prediction 
models based on machine learning methods. A classification of individual 
movement options and collective phenomena in different density ranges is 
used to critically discuss current model approaches and their advantages 
and disadvantages. The last part of the lecture is dedicated to 
empirical results on waiting behavior and first modelling approaches. 
The focus is on waiting on platforms and in queueing systems for event 
venues.
