# Save the Date!

June 01-04, 2026, in Berlin.

The SUMO Conference, held every year in Berlin since 2013, is a must-attend event for anyone involved with SUMO. It gathers international participants from the industry, research and public institutions - to present (among others) projects, studies and advancements all around traffic, simulation and SUMO.

The conference offers opportunities to learn about new features, connect with other users, engage with the developers, exchange ideas, and even start new collaborations.

# Call for Papers

The conference focuses on presenting new and unique results in the field of mobility simulation and modelling using openly available tools and data. We expect a large variety of research topics and usage approaches.
Possible areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

- AI-based traffic modelling / AI-assisted simulation
- Data-driven calibration and validation
- Intermodal transport and shared mobility
- Simulation for traffic safety and risk assessment
- Real-time traffic prediction and control
- Large-scale simulation and high-performance computing
- Mobility and demand modelling
- Open tools and open data
- Traffic management solutions
- Sustainable urban traffic planning
- Autonomous driving
- Goods traffic and logistics simulation
- Digital twins in Intelligent transportation systems
- E-Mobility
- Vehicular communication

**3. SUMO Moments**

To celebrate 25 years of SUMO, we invite the community to share *"SUMO Moments"* - short reflections, anecdotes, or milestones from your work with the software and the people around it. These stories can highlight technical breakthroughs, memorable challenges, or personal experiences that shaped your connection to SUMO.

- You are welcome to share:
  - Your first encounter with the SUMO community - for example your first ticket, bug report, or mailing list message
  - A key moment in a research project or application where SUMO played an important role
  - A surprising result, a lesson learned, or a simulation mishap that taught you something
  - Encounters with users, developers, or collaborators who influenced your work
  - Any memory that shows what SUMO has meant to you, your project, or your career
- Contributors will be able to register under the *Authors & Project Partners* special rate.
- **Submit a description (up to 300 words) until Sunday, ~~February 22, 2026~~ March 01, 2026 - 23:59 UTC.**

Selected submissions will be featured as brief presentations during the conference as part of the 25-year anniversary program. The goal is to capture the human side of the SUMO journey - the challenges, discoveries, and community interactions that have shaped the project over the past decades.
